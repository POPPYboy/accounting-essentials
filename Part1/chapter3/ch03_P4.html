                <h2>📚 Background & Principles</h2>
                <p>Accrued revenue represents services performed or goods delivered but not yet billed or recorded. Accruals ensure revenues are matched with the period when earned.</p>

                <div class="concept-card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Revenue must be recognized when EARNED (service performed or product delivered). If work is done but not recorded, an accrual is needed to ensure proper matching.
                </div>

                <p>Accruals can relate to both revenues and expenses. For revenues, we record what we've earned but not yet billed. For expenses, we record what we've incurred but not yet paid.</p>

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Accruals ensure financial statements reflect economic reality rather than just cash movements. They're essential for accurate profit measurement under accrual accounting.

                <h2>🚫 Common Misconceptions & Professional Tips</h2>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 1:</strong> "Accrued revenue means we already billed the customer."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Accrued revenue can be for unbilled work OR billed work not yet delivered. The key is that the service is PERFORMED, not whether billing occurred.
                </div>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 2:</strong> "Accrued expenses should be recorded when we plan to pay them."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Accrued expenses are recorded when INCURRED (when service is received or benefit enjoyed), not when paid. Matching principle requires expense recognition in the period it helps generate.
                </div>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 3:</strong> "Reversing entries are optional and can be skipped."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Reversing entries are REQUIRED after accruals are settled to prevent double-counting. Without reversing, you'd record the expense or revenue twice.

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #1:</strong> Always document the reason for accruals. Why is revenue not yet recorded? Why is expense not yet paid? This creates audit trail.
                </div>

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #2:</strong> Calculate accruals based on reasonable estimates. For partial periods, estimate proportionally based on time elapsed.
                </div>

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #3:</strong> Review accrued balances at each period-end. Large accrual balances that never settle may indicate billing or payment issues.
