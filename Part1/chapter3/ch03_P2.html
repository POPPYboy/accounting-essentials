                <h2>📚 Background & Principles</h2>
                <p>Unearned revenue represents advance payments from customers for goods or services that will be provided in the future. Until the service is performed, this is a liability, not revenue.</p>

                <div class="concept-card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Revenue must be recognized when EARNED (service performed or product delivered), not when cash is received. Unearned revenue follows this principle.
                </div>

                <p>As time passes and service is provided, the liability decreases and revenue increases. This is called "recognizing revenue."</p>

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Unearned revenue is a type of deferral. It ensures revenue is matched with the period in which the service was actually provided, adhering to the matching principle.

                <h2>🚫 Common Misconceptions & Professional Tips</h2>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 1:</strong> "Unearned revenue is a reduction in revenue."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Unearned revenue is a LIABILITY, not a revenue reduction. It's recorded as a liability until service is performed, then it becomes revenue. The timing changes, not the total amount.
                </div>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 2:</strong> "Once cash is received, revenue should be recognized immediately."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Revenue recognition is based on EARNING (service performed or product delivered), not on cash receipt. If cash is received in advance for future services, it's recorded as unearned revenue liability first.
                </div>

                <div class="misconception-alert">
                    <strong>❌ Misconception 3:</strong> "Unearned revenue adjustments are optional."
                    

                    <strong>✅ Reality:</strong> Unearned revenue adjustments are REQUIRED under accrual accounting. Without them, revenue is recognized too early (violating matching principle) or too late (creating misleading financial statements).
                </div>

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #1:</strong> Always track unearned revenue separately from regular revenue. They serve different purposes and have different implications for cash flow and working capital.

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #2:</strong> Review unearned revenue balances regularly. Large unearned revenue balances may indicate customer dissatisfaction or billing problems.

                <div class="professional-tip">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Tip #3:</strong> When recognizing unearned revenue, ensure the adjusting entry is recorded in the correct accounting period. If service is performed January 1-15, recognize revenue in January, not December.
